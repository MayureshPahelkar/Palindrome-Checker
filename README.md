# Palindrome-Checker
This project is a Palindrome Checker built using HTML, CSS, and PHP. The user types any word or string into an input field and clicks the "Check Palindrome" button. PHP receives the input, reverses the string, and compares it with the original value. If both are the same, the program identifies it as a palindrome; otherwise, it states that it is not a palindrome. The interface is designed using HTML and CSS to give a clean and user-friendly look, and the result is displayed clearly on the screen.
